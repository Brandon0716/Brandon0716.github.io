So, I personally thought i was getting the hang of it, but does seem there is still so much more to learn. Which makes me feel more excited, knowing i am personally looking into a career where ever day is a new type of challenge.  I recently have picked a book called, " Learn Ruby the Hard Way"  BY Zed A. Shaw comes with a dvd 5+hour lecture, really excited about it i am hoping it, helps smooth out the path just  a little bit. Came across a few other books as well and i was shown a few good ebooks which, i am honestly excited to jump into.
