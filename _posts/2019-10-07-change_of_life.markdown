I am a father of three wonderful little girls, and right now i run a robotic polisher for my job. It is not a hard job i just don't like spending 60 hours a week away from my family, just to keep my family above float. I know since there really isn't to much good paying jobs out there without a degree or training i knew it was my time, my time to make a change for me and my family. I know noone else will make this change for me so i must step up and do it. I am happy that  i do have a job that helps support my big family but i would love to enjoy my big family more than just on the weekends or few mins before work.
